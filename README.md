NFMT ("Never Forget" Memory Token)

## Project inspiration / background

I wrote this in my Facebook on 8th May 2022:

===

_WW2 Remembrance Day (Victory in Europe) today._

_Over 1.3m (!) Ukrainian soldiers have died in the battles against the nazists during WW2._

_Total human losses of Ukraine including civilian and deported people over 10m during 1939-1945._

_Ukrainian Army is now fighting to fulfill that "Never Again" - to protect Europe and the World against another catastrophe driven by a crazy dictator and a brainwashed nation._

===

It was important for me to launch this project on this date. I devote it to the defenders of freedom, peace and civilization who fight protecting our world from barbarism and destruction. These days Ukrainian army continues its heroic fight writing fresh lines into world history, with their blood, sweat and tears. The war that is happening now is a mistake, like many wars before that. Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it (c) Winston Churchill. 


## Core difference from NFT

NFMT is similar to NFT tokens, but it allows anybody who sees a token they like, to mint a copy of such NFMT token, for free (just paying the gas fees).

This type of contract will work well for cases where users want to save a copy of a content focused digital asset such a photograph, digital collectible, memorabilia, text, music, video, meme to their own wallet, therefore helping to create an immutable digital trace, "memory" of this item on blockchain. Content stored this way can be accessed by the wallet owner as well as other users. 

Core difference here is that the issuance is unlimited and users can mint as many copies as they want, as long as they want it and the pay the gas fee.

## Future plans

* Fundraising / chariry aspect - minting a copy requies a fee that goes to designated charities
* Payments / commissions to mint going to the owners of the rights if it is a copyrighted material.
