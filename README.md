# NFMT ("Never Forget" Memory Token)
Note: the NFMT acronim can be interpreted in different ways. Current interpretation reflects my insipration to start this. 
The best recognition however would be the community adoption and it is inevitable that many projects and applications might branch into topics that have nothing to do with "Never Forget". In such case the community can apply or develop more universally fitting interpretations, such for example as "__Nearly Fungible Multi Token__" or "__Meme Token__". This is welcome - if this project helps someone maybe there is a tiny proportion of people who will read the history behind it and think about that stuff.  

## Project inspiration / background

I wrote this in my Facebook today on 8th May 2022:

===

_WW2 Remembrance Day (Victory in Europe) today._

_Over 1.3m (!) Ukrainian soldiers have died in the battles against the nazists during WW2._

_Total human losses of Ukraine including civilian and deported people over 10m during 1939-1945._

_Ukrainian Army is now fighting to fulfill that "Never Again" - to protect Europe and the World against another catastrophe driven by a crazy dictator and a brainwashed nation._

===

It was important for me to launch this project on this date. I devote it to the defenders of freedom, peace and civilization who fight protecting our world from barbarism and destruction. These days Ukrainian army continues its heroic fight writing fresh lines into world history, with their blood, sweat and tears. The war that is happening now is a mistake, like many wars before that. Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it (c) Winston Churchill. 


## Core difference from NFT

NFMT is similar to NFT tokens, but it allows anybody who sees a token they like, to mint a copy of such NFMT token, for free (just paying the gas fees).

This type of contract will work well for cases where users want to save a copy of a content focused digital asset such a photograph, digital collectible, memorabilia, text, music, video, meme to their own wallet, therefore helping to create an immutable digital trace, "memory" of this item on blockchain. Content stored this way can be accessed by the wallet owner as well as other users. 

Core difference here is that the issuance is unlimited and users can mint as many copies as they want, as long as they want it and the pay the gas fee.

## Future plans

* Fundraising / chariry aspect - minting a copy requies a fee that goes to designated charities
* Payments / commissions to mint going to the owners of the rights if it is a copyrighted material.

## Crypto Tokens -> NFT -> Meme Tokens

As both user and technologist, I find the NFT format both facinating and limited. Cryptocurrencies and fungible tokens such as ERC-20 have changed our life enormously offering a way to create and trade digital money in a decentralized and trustless way, without the need for any intermediaries or gatekeepers. They have been successfull but were missing "soul" limiting its adoption by the public. NFT tokens have appeared later to become extremely popular with wide masses of users as they focused on the art, the act of creation and the content. This has added "soul" or at least face and individuality to cryptographic tokens.

NFTs however have their own limitations. It is almost certain, of course, that these limitations will be overcome through evolution and projects like this one that attempt to improve upon the standard. "Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics".

What I personally find lacking in NFTs, or should we say generally in current decentralized economy tech around the content.

## __1. Memes and file attachments.__
Users can post memes and stickers on social media. You can copy an existent meme or slightly modify it. You can install sticker packs. Why can't the same be done with NFTs? I understand that NFTs are "non-fungible" and that some / most of them include rights to the content presented in them (not really - read for example the small T&C print in the NBA Top Shot NFT tokens etc - but let's pretend legally it is the case). There would however be cases where copying is allowed - such as 'fair use' similar to what happens with memes, or in case where the copyright owner is actually happy for their content to be distributed (see "Creative Commons" and other similar licenses).

Here I should also mention another inspiration or a pain point that has led to this project. I wanted to __marry NFTs with files that people send or keep in their profiles__. As in messengers and social networks. You can post and send files, but they are not NFTs. Why don't we allow all those files to be NFTs - whenever users want? We have a product called Ethora (github repo: https://github.com/dappros/ethora) where users can mint NFTs as simple as pick a file from your phone gallery, upload and - boom - it's in your wallet and is show in your profile. You can then go and send it to other users in a chat. Users in the chat can tap on each other profiles and see what NFTs users own, view those images, play videos and music etc. 

Now, coming closer to our topic - another feature we are adding now in Ethora is a possibility to convert a file seen somewhere in the chat (file attachments) into NFTs. Actually all attachments can be NFTs, or provisional NFTs, as long as community is happy no rights are violated and users or the system are happy to pay the gas fees.

## __1.1. "Stealing" the meme.__
Continuing the discourse within our social / messaging context, it is perfectly OK for someone to "steal" a meme or install the same sticker pack if they like something that has been shared online by another user. It is not OK and is normally impossible to steal an NFT by copying (well, again that has been a laughing matter for some, but we won't go into that here - technically you can copy but it will be a different token with different provenance). For NFMTs however it is perfectly OK to "steal" it. It is allowed and encouraged to mint your own copies of NFMT. Smart contract fully supports that. 

OK so we have figured out that duplicating or cloning NFTs could be useful in some applications as long as we can technically implement it and all sides are happy.

## __2. Decentralized Copyright handling.__

Now, this is a huge topic so I will just explain it very roughly and very far from professional legal language. The way I feel about this as a user and a tech enterpreneur. 

The way copyright and media licensing is handled currently is very inefficient. It can and should be revolutionazed with smart contracts. 

Let me explain the pain point. I want to be able to create a Youtube video and put my favourite Metallica song as a background music. I'm happy for the band to receive any revenues from the ads that Youtube runs etc. I'm not selling my video, I just put it out there for free. Metallica could actually be happy if thousands of people add their music to their videos and millions of ad views generate revenues for them. This isn't how it works currently sadly. You are supposed to get an explicit permit from the artist. That is fair of course, what I believe is wrong about this is that there is no smart contract or a decentralized platform which allows Metallica to pre-approve the transactional use of their songs and automatically get revenues from each use. All miss out here - the artist, the derivative content maker and the end user.
